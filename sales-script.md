# Sales Scripts for SkyGuyver Subscription Plans

These scripts are designed for outbound calls, inbound demos, or email sequences (adapt as needed). They're conversational, benefit-focused, and tailored to NZ SMBs (e.g., solo tradespeople, small service firms like plumbers or real estate agents). Emphasize ROI: "Save 5-10 hours/week on calls, book 20% more jobs via AI." Keep calls <5 mins; end with a clear CTA (e.g., "Let's get you set up in 10 minutes"). Use your React dashboard for live demos.

**General Tips**:

- **Opener Hook**: Reference a pain point (e.g., "Missed calls costing you jobs?").
- **Build Value**: Tie to NZ specifics (e.g., local numbers, Google integrations).
- **Handle Objections**: Prep for "Too expensive" → "ROI in week 1: $500+ in bookings." For trial requests: "I can explore a limited demo if it helps close the gap—let's discuss your needs first."
- **Close**: Highlight low commitment (e.g., monthly billing, easy cancel); annual 15% discount.
- **Tracking**: Log in Supabase; follow up via n8n email automation.
